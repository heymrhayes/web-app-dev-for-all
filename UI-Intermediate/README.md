# UI Intermediate 

Over time, designers and developers wanted more capability and flexibilty to handle design challenges and the explosion of screen sizes.  The CSS standard continued to evolve, adding capabilities such as Flexbox and Media Queries.  And the HTML specification added the `viewport` meta tag (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp), giving developers greater control over the device screen.

Developers utilized these capabilities to develop Responsive Web Design (RWD) - a strategy to allow the elements in a web page to display based on the screen size.

Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open-source RWD project from Twitter.  After including the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files, we can include Bootstrap __components__ - HTML elements, grouped and styled to achieve specific display and layout goals. (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## Examples in this project

[bootstrap_basic.html](./bootstrap_basic.html) is a basic Bootstrap page, with all the necessary file includes and a few components.

[bootstrap_intermediate.html](./bootstrap_intermediate.html) includes a navbar, carousel and card components, showing responsive behavior as you resize the screen.
