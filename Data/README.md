# Data

Most apps connect data to a user interface, and we can do that in our web apps.  Our scripts can make __AJAX__ calls to a data __API__ , and the response is (usually) in __JSON__ (JavaScript Object Notation) so that we can programmatically work with it.

We can use JavaScript and the __jQuery__ library to easily manipulate the __DOM__ based on the data we receive.



## Examples in this project

[data_basic.html](./data_basic.html) makes a simple AJAX request and logs the response to the console.

[data_dom_update.html](./data_dom_update.html) makes a simple DOM update with some of the returned data.

[data_multiple_endpoints.html](./data_multiple_endpoints.html) makes calls to different APIs to demonstrate different response formats.

[data_dom_update_intermediate.html](./data_dom_update_intermediate.html) updates the __DOM__ with a Bootstrap Card compoenent for each record.
