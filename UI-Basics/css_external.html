		<h1>Some Basic CSS</h1>
		<div>This page includes some basic css styling.  Look at the <strong>style</strong> block inside the <strong>head</strong> element.</div>
		<div id="special">You can also include all your CSS in a separate file and create a link to it in every page of your site that needs it.  </div>
