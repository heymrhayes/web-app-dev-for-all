# UI Basics 

HyperText Markup Langauge (HTML) is the language of web pages, but we can also think of it as the language for describing the elements of a __User Interface__, or UI ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface ). Because a good user experience can make or break a product, companies spend a lot of time on UI and UX design.
