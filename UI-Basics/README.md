# UI Basics 

HyperText Markup Langauge (HTML) is the language of web pages, but we can also think of it as the language for describing the elements of a __User Interface__, or UI ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); companies spend a lot of time on UI Design (https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design) because design can make or break a product. 

[html5_basic.html](./html5_basic.html) is a minimal HTML5-compliant template.

[css_basic.html](./css_basic.html) includes a few tags with some styling using CSS.
